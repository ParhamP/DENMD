A toolbox for generating higher-dimensional manifolds of time-series data using delay embedding methods and measuring nonlinear mutual dynamics between them using cross mapping techniques.

## Overview

We've employed dynamical systems approaches to compile a toolbox that:
1. Performs dynamical embedding of a time series to assay complexity and determine meaningful dimensions of activity
2. Parses linear and nonlinear dynamics
3. Assays causal asymmetry in reciprocal interactions between correlated signals

## Download

1. From a command line:

```

2. Or simply "Download Zip" from Github's "Code" tab

## Install

In MATLAB:

```
addpath(genpath('AbsolutePathToToolbox'))
```
